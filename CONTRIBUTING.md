# Contributing

Branching strategy
- Protect `main` for releases; use `develop` for integration and `feat/*` for features.

PRs
- Open PRs against `develop` for feature work. Require at least one review and passing CI before merge.

Commit messages
- Use Conventional Commits (feat/, fix/, chore/, docs/).

Code of conduct and other policies should be added as needed.
